  HW 61 -- Instructions so Simple... -- Implement Merge Sort
  time: .3 hours
  
  DISCO:
  - An effective base case for the sort method would just be checking if the deck only has one element. 
  QCC:
  - What sorting method is faster than merge sort?
  
  class MergeSort
  Implements mergesort on array of ints.
  Summary of Algorithm:
	Our algo first checks if there is only 1 item in the array, if so then it returns the list of that item.
  If not, our algo splits the list into 2 approx equal array. The algo calls the sort method on these arrays, and then 
  merges the two arrays. The resultant array is then returned.
