println allows the next thing printed to be printed on a new line

The output :
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. 
No, I wug. ---- this is state of the program after ping has been invoked once

We are at a state where the next thing printed will be on a new line.

If we try to invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method, there will be an infinite amount of 
wug. , each being on a new line.
