Activity 1

1a) sentimentVal(String word)
1b) The parameter asks for a string, and passing it any other variable type will make the code uncompilable
1c) The method returns a double

2)  "academy"   0.61
    "painful"   -3.69
    "smart"     1.04

3a) Would compile because the variable type and parameter match sentimentVal
3b) Would not compile because sentimentVal does not take a double as a parameter, and the return type is not a string
3c) Would not compile because sentimentVal does not take 2 parameters

Activity 2

2) -5.539999999999999

4) totalSentiment finds the index of the first space in the input file, and then creates a substring from 0 to that index. 
   punctuation is removed from that substring, and then sentimentVal is run on it, and the value returned is added to a variable named total
   the file is then set to a substring of itself with the first word removed, and the above steps repeat
   the loop breaks when the index of the first space is -1, then sentimentVal is run on the whole file rather than a substring of the file (punctuation is still removed beforehand)

5a) Not exactly because reviews with few words will get a lower star rating, even if the review is positive
5b) We could average the rating of every word, or make the star rating dependent on a ratio of positive to negative words

6) He probably intends for the code to run like "if totalSentiment is greater than 5 but less than 10, then return 3". 
   But the current code can't test for those intervals because if totalSentiment is less than 15, it just returns 4 and does no other checks. 
   This can be fixed by either flipping the signs in the boolean expressions, or reversing the order of the boolean expressions


Activity 3

3) You can split a string into two parts by using indexOf() to find a specific character where you want to make the split. Then use substring 
   to create a string of everything up to that index. then use substring again to create a string of everything after that index. You need to add 
   1 to the index to copy the remaining half because otherwise indexOf() will keep returning the same number

5) Non-static methods belong to the instance of their class, so you need to create an object to use them. Static methods can be used without
   creating an object, which is why we did not need to create a Review object to run the methods Inconsiderate

6) If we want positive reviews, have fakeReview() replace adjectives with only positive adjectives. If we want negative reviews, use only negative adjectives

Activity 4

1) To sabotage your competition
2) To make yourself seem better

3) First take the sentiment value of the entire review
   If the sentiment is negative, then add negative adjectives
   If the sentiment is positive, then add positive adjectives

5) The result is oneWord with the first character removed
6) The asterick has to be removed because otherwise the word will not be recognized and sentimentVal will be 0
7) Replace words with a adjectives that have a high sentiment value. Ex: only use words with sentiment greater than 1

Activity 5

1) We hate vowels
2) If this question is referring to how we worked as a team, then we worked on parts of the code individually, and then double checked each others' work 
   to make everything work together.

   We took getPunctuation() and removePunctuation() from the other parts of this lab, and we took hasA() from the pig latin lab
   We also created a final string of vowels as was done in the pig latin lab
   We made a helper method first that removes the vowels in a word, then made a method to use that helper method on every word in a string

3) public static String removeVowels(String phrase)
   The parameter is a String because you can't remove vowels from something that can't have letters
   The method is static because we didn't see any point in making an object in order to use the methods

4) for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
        letter = word.substring(i, i + 1);
        if(!hasA(vowels, letter.toUpperCase())) {
          output += word.charAt(i);
        }
      }

   The code uses .toUpperCase() to check if the letter at index i is a vowel. The letter is made uppercase because all the vowels in
   out final String vowel are uppercase, and they need to both be uppercase to be compared

   If the character is not a vowel, then charAt() is used to add the character at that index to the final output

5) while(phrase.length() > 0 && phrase.indexOf(" ") != -1) {
        nextWord = phrase.substring(0, phrase.indexOf(" "));
        noVowels += removeVowelsHelper(nextWord);
        noVowels += " ";
        phrase = phrase.substring(phrase.indexOf(" ") + 1);
      }

   The above code could be rewritten using nested boolean statements:

   while(phrase.length() > 0) {
        if (phrase.indexOf(" ") != -1) {
            nextWord = phrase.substring(0, phrase.indexOf(" "));
            noVowels += removeVowelsHelper(nextWord);
            noVowels += " ";
            phrase = phrase.substring(phrase.indexOf(" ") + 1);
        } else break;
      }

6)  for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
        letter = word.substring(i, i + 1);
        if(!hasA(vowels, letter.toUpperCase())) {
          output += word.charAt(i);
        }
      }

    The loop iterates starting from 0 and stopping when i is equal to the length of the input. With each iteration, it checks if the character
    at index i is not a vowel. If it's not a vowel, then the letter is added to the output. Otherwise, it is skipped

    equivalent code: 

    int i = 0;
    while (i < word.length()) {
        letter = word.substring(i, i + 1);
        if(!hasA(vowels, letter.toUpperCase())) {
          output += word.charAt(i);
        }
        i++;
    }
