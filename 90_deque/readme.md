# Mister George, Ziying, Diana, Weichen

To-Do (in order):

## ACCESSORS:

* peekFirst(): returns the head of the deque
* peekLast(): returns the tail of the deque

## MUTATORS: 
* addFirst(e): add to the front of the deque
* addLast(e): add to the back of the deque
* removeFirst(): remove from the front of the deque
* removeLast(): remove from the back of the deque
* offerFirst(e): return and insert element to the front of the deque unless it viotes capacity limit 
* pollFirst(): return and remove the first element of the deque unless it is empty, which it will return null. 
* offerLast(e): return and insert element to the back of the deque unless it viotes capacity limit 
* pollLast(): return and remove the last element of the deque unless it is empty, which it will return null. 

## PLAN:
* We plan to work on the interface/ourImplementationOfDeque by starting with the accessors then moving on to the mutators.
