time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- An array has to be sorted if there is only one element in the array!

QCC:
- Is there a sort method faster than merge sort?
- If it's true that the last person to receive the cards does some kind of sorting, then what is it that they do? Is it different from what everyone else is doing?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- Only thinkeren with cards are allowed to speak. 
- They may only speak to <3 other thinkeren.
- When a thinker has >1 card, split the deck in half and give one each to two other thinkeren. Signal that you hands are empty.
- If a thinker's hands are empty and has not gotten a deck yet, receive a split deck from another thinker.
- If a thinker has 1 card, it is declared sorted. Return the card to the thinker who originally gave it to you.
- When you receive 2 decks of cards, look at the first card of each deck and sort them accordingly into one new deck. 
- Repeat steps until the deck is sorted.
