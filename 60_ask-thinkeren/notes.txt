DISCO:
- An array has to be sorted if there is only one element in the array!

QCC:
- Is there a sort method faster than merge sort?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- Only thinkeren with cards are allowed to speak. 
- They may only speak to <3 other thinkeren.
- When a thinker has >1 card, split the deck in half and give one each to two other thinkeren. Signal that you hands are empty.
- If a thinker's hands are empty and has not gotten a deck yet, receive a split deck from another thinker.
- If a thinker has 1 card, it is declared sorted. Return the card to the thinker who originally gave it to you.
- When you receive 2 decks of cards, look at the first card of each deck and sort them accordingly into one new deck. 
- Repeat steps until the deck is sorted.
