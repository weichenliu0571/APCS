/*
DISCOVERIES
- Static is needed to use instance variables in the same class. 
- If a class is executable, then its method must be static. 
- You could use a setter method to change private variables.
QCC
- Is it possible to not use static when running a method in the same class. 
Team Geese's Latest and Greatest Q2 Response:
- When generating an instance of a class, new ClassName();, parenthesis are used, which denotes a method. 
- An object is created, which means that something returned the object when instance is created.
Team Geese's Latest and Greatest Q3 Response:
- create object
- try System.out.println(objName)
- check is valid output is given.
