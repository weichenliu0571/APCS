0. "base" in "base-x number system" refers to the number of unique digits used to represent a value. For example, base-2 means that there are 2 unique digits. These 2 unique digits are used to encode a certain value or signal. 

1. Binary is a base-2 number system, consisting of 2 unique digits (0s and 1s). Binary is the number system used by computers. Binary's simplicity allows a computer to store data since a computer is only capable of storing two states, OFF and ON, respectively. 

2. Binary -> Decimal

2.0. Use a for loop to iterate through the array (the binary value), starting from the rightmost digit. The binary number will be treated as an array. 
2.1. Multiply the rightmost digit by 2^0. For every digit to the left, multiply the digit by 2^n, in which each consecutive n is one greater than that of the previous exponent. This process, or loop, will continue until we reach the leftmost digit. 
2.2. While the loop is iterating, there should be an accumulator for the sum of the decimal numbers. The accumulator is the final decimal number. 

Example:
	1010
	0 * 2^0 = 0
	1 * 2^1 = 2
	0 * 2^2 = 0
	1 * 2^3 = 8
	0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10
	
	11101
	1 * 2^0 = 1
	0 * 2^1 = 0
	1 * 2^2 = 4
	1 * 2^3 = 8
	1 * 2^4 = 16
	1 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 29

3. Decimal -> Binary

3.0. Divide the decimal number by 2 once. 
3.1. Record the remainder (either 0 or 1) in an array.
3.2. Repeat steps 0 and 1 with the resulting quotients until the final quotient is 0.
3.4. Return the array and rearrange the array so that the remainders are in reverse order of the direction in which they were stored.

Example: 
	10
	10 / 2 = 5r0
	5 / 2 = 2r1
	2 / 2 = 1r0
	1 / 2 = 0r1
	1010
	
	29
	29 / 2 = 14r1
	14 / 2 = 7r0
	7 / 2 = 3r1
	3 / 2 = 1r1
	1 / 2 = 0r1
	11101
