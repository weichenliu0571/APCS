time spent: 0.5 hrs

WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS:

* This pde file demos simple movement of an object controlled with key presses
* Constantly refreshing background so that old objects are erased and so they appear at new location.
* Can create window and processing app w/ little code unlike Swing set.

WHY WE CARE:

* A lot of our ideas involve moving objects and key presses so it would be nice to familiarize ourselves with how it works in Processing.
